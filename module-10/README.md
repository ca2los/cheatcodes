### *Getting to know OOP*
This module of the TDMBC has been a real challenge because of these factors: 
**Promises**, **Module Exports**, **Clases** and *JEST*. My God, the last one is 
one to be afraid of :S

### Installation
In order to run the folder `index_07` you must install Node JS and NPM to test and
run the analysis. Here you have the *how-to*: 

#### *Node JS*
To check if **Node JS** is already installed, from your `Terminal Console` enter the
command `node -v` and press the **ENTER** key. It will show you a message with the
version of Node only if the package was installed before. If the message is different,
[click the link](https://nodejs.org/en/) and download the recommended version of the
package and install it.

#### *NPM*
To check if **NPM** is already installed, from your `Terminal Console` enter the
command `npm -v` and press the **ENTER** key. It will show you a message with the
version of Node only if the package was installed before. If the message is different,
then enter the command `npm install`and press the **ENTER** key.

### How to debug
From your terminal console, go through your files and locate the folder `index_07`. 
Enter the command `npm run test` and press the **ENTER** key. Now you will see a 
list with results.

```text
    // Command to initialize the program
    $ npm run test
```

### How to test
From your terminal console and in the same folder, run the command `node index.js`
and press ENTER. You will see the execution of the program.

```text
    // Command to initialize the program
    $ node index.js
```

#### *WHAT IT DOES?*
1. The `npm run test` initialize the debugging of the project to show you any error.
2. While `node index.js` executes the program at the terminal console.
